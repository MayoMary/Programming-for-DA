    "## Programming for Analytics assignment\n",
    "Mary McHale\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment is based on using the numpy.random package in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose of the package\n",
    "Numpy is the primary package used for performing scientific calculations(e.g. the generation of random numbers, linear algebra) and data analysis in Python. The Numpy name is short for Numerical Python. NumPy includes:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Standard mathematical functions (e.g. addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) for quick calculations on entire arrays of data. The advantage of NumPy is that it has functions to do this in one step, otherwise Python could only perform this by using loops and for large data, this would use up a lot of memory and time to get the required result.\n",
    " \n",
    " - ndarray, a key feature, a fast and adaptable container for large data sets in Python where 'nd' denotes the dimension size.\n",
    " \n",
    " - NumPy can be used with other Python packages quite eaasily for higher level data analytical functionality\n",

    " #### Explain the use and purposes of at least 5 'Distributions' functions\n",
    " - (1) Normal, called standard Normal dsitribution\n",
    " In statistics, normal distribution of data is used the most. It is also referred to as the 'bell curve' or the 'Gaussian curve' named after Karl Gauss who was a mathematician and was instrumental in its devlopment but it was Abraham de Moivre who first discovered the normal distribution. There is many normal distributions as they can have different means and standard deviations.\n",
    "In normal distributions, the data is displayed symmetrically where more values are at the center of the distribution and less values for the extremes. ??  ???? ????I changed these words around.......normal distributions are symmetric with relatively more values at the center of the distribution and relatively few in the tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most other distributions have their roots in the normal distribution\n",
    "......By fitting a Normal curve on the experimental data, one can weed out those data points which appear to be abnormal or influenced by some assignable cause. Thus the results of the experiment will be more realistic.\n",
    " Seven features of normal distributions are listed below. These features are illustrated in more detail in the remaining sections of this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal distributions are symmetric around their mean.\n",
    "The mean, median, and mode of a normal distribution are equal.\n",
    "The area under the normal curve is equal to 1.0.\n",
    "Normal distributions are denser in the center and less dense in the tails.\n",
    "Normal distributions are defined by two parameters, the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ).\n",
    "68% of the area of a normal distribution is within one standard deviation of the mean.\n",
    "Approximately 95% of the area of a normal distribution is within two standard deviations of the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference : http://onlinestatbook.com/2/normal_distribution/intro.html\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard normal distribution allocates scores based on results ??? performance relative to how others results ???? performed in the same population.\n",
    "The advantage of this is that it allows for correct comparisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that standard deviation is a measure of spread; it is an average distance of data points away from the mean.\n",
    "Thus, comparing across distributions is akin to comparing apples to oranges. To make an informed decision, we will covert all scores to the same scale. We will standardize the scores, converting them to the standard normal distribution, with a single mean and a single standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard normal distribution, commonly referred to the Z-distribution, is a special case of a normal distribution with the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "It has a mean of zero.\n",
    "It has a standard deviation of one.\n",
    "Areas under the density curve can be found using a standard normal table\n",

The geometric distribution would represent the number of people who you had to poll before you found someone who voted independent. You would need to get a certain number of failures before you got your first success.\n",

For example, if p = 0.2 then your probability of success is .2 and your probability of failure is 1 – 0.2 = 0.8. Independence (i.e. that the outcome of one trial does not affect the next) means that you can multiply the probabilities together. So the probability of failing on your second try is (1-p)(1-p) and your probability of failing on the nth-1 tries is (1-p)n-1. If you succeeded on your 4th try, n = 4, n – 1 = 3, so the probability of failing up to that point is (1-p)(1-p)(1-p) = (1-p)3.\n",
